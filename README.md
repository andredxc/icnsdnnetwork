## ICN SDN Network

This repository has the objective of executing experiments that are capable to validate the integration of an ICN (Information-centric Network) along with a SDN (Software-defined Network). 

To setup and execute the experiments it is needed to install all the components present in this repository (netbee, ryu, minindn along with mininet and uBPF). All the steps to install them are present inside their own folders in the READ.md.

After all the dependencies are installed it is possible to execute a few ready experiments.
